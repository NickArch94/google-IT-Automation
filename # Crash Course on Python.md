# Crash Course on Python

### Syntax
- The rules for how instructions tend to be written.

### Semantics
- The effects of the instructions.

### Scripts vs Programmes:
**Scripts** are short/simple programs that can be run very quickly to run very specific tasks.
**Programmes** are fully-fledged programs that take longer development cycles to get properly functioning.

The process of **Automation** is replacing manual steps with ones that take place automatically.

### When is Automation to be used?
For large, time-consuming tasks that can be streamlined by computers. This frees up the individual to focus on a more intensive task.

## Why Python?
Python is easy to write, maintain, and understand. This makes writing code with much more beginner friendly. Also, Being available on many platforms, Python is able to be utilized on a wide range of different systems.

### Functions:
- a section of code used to perform as a whole.

### Keywords:
- Reserved words Python uses for specific instuctions.

### JupyterLabs & Jupyter Notebooks
- Jupyter Notebooks are web-based, self-contained environments thtat let you develop and debug Python code within a Juptyer Notebook itself.
- JupyerLab is a FOSS web-based environment to host Jupyter notebooks.

## Practice Code:
"Consider this scenario about using Python to make calculations:

In a managed computing environment, there are 200 remote computers that must download 200 MB (megabytes) of updates each month. There are 1024 KB (kilobytes) in each MB.

Fill in the blank in the code below to compute the number of total kilobytes downloaded by all computers from the remote update server each month. Multiply the total number of computers by the download size in KB to calculate."

``` python
download_size_kb = 200*1024
total_computers = 200
total_kbs = 40960000.0 

print(total_kbs) 
#40960000.0
```
